# Session Reflection and CLAUDE.md Update

Reflect on this session and update CLAUDE.md as needed.

## Reflection Points

1. **What was learned**: New discoveries and insights from this session
2. **User preferences**: Coding style, commit message conventions, naming conventions, etc.
3. **Project-specific patterns**: Important architecture and design patterns for this project
4. **Failures and lessons**: What didn't work well, what to avoid in the future
5. **Useful commands**: Frequently used commands and workflows

## Update Rules

- Do not duplicate existing CLAUDE.md content
- Only add specific and practical information
- Do not add overly generic content (e.g., "write readable code")

## When Updates Are Not Needed

- The session only involved answering simple questions
- Everything was already covered by existing CLAUDE.md content
- It was temporary or one-time work with no insights applicable to future sessions

If no update is needed, do not force additions. Simply report "No updates were necessary."

## Procedure

1. First, read the current CLAUDE.md
2. Organize insights gained from this session
3. If there is content to add, append it to CLAUDE.md
4. Report what was added to the user
