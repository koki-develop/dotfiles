- **Must do**: Run `afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Funk.aiff` whenever finishing work.
- **Notification sound before standby**: Always execute `afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Funk.aiff` before returning to standby state (whether task is complete, awaiting user input, or pausing for any reason) to alert the user.
- **Shell command execution**: Always execute shell commands via the `command` builtin (e.g., `command ls` instead of `ls`) to bypass aliases and ensure consistent behavior.
